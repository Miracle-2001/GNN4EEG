<!-- Electroencephalography (EEG) classification is a crucial task in neuroscience, neural engineering, and several commercial applications. Traditional EEG classification models, however, have often overlooked or inadequately leveraged the brainâ€™s topological information. Recognizing this shortfall, there has been a burgeoning interest in recent years in harnessing the potential of Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to exploit the topological information by modeling features selected from each EEG channel in a graph structure. 

However, it remains challenging to evaluate the transferability of these models and implement GNN-based EEG classification models in practice due to the lack of easy-to-use toolkits and large-scale public benchmarks. To tackle this, we build GNN4EEG, a benchmark and toolkit for EEG classification with GNN. -->

GNN4EEG is a benchmark and toolkit focusing on   Electroencephalography (EEG) classification tasks via Graph Neural Network (GNN), aiming to facilitate research in this direction. The toolkit comprises three components: 

- **(i)**: A large
benchmark constructed with four EEG classification tasks based on
EEG data collected from 123 participants. 

- **(ii)**:  Easy-to-use implementations on various state-of-the-art GNN-based EEG classification
models, e.g., DGCNN, RGNN, etc. 

- **(iii)**:  Implementations of comprehensive experimental settings and evaluation protocols, e.g., data
splitting protocols, and cross-validation protocols.

Specifically, GNN4EEG implements **4 EEG classification tasks** as the benchmark, **3 validation protocols** , and **4 GNN models** .
